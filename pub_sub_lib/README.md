# WIP: publisher-subscriber Library

Publisher and subscriber implementation with Tokio. It is a pet project that it keeps in WIP, it doesn't pretend to be a production tool (yet). It is added a makefile to execute different targets: 
* An example server
* An example client 
* An example of manager which integrates the server and client operations (`notify` and `subscribe` and `unsubscribe`)

to run: `make run-manager` `make run-client` or `make run-server`
